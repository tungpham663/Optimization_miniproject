<h3>Problem</h3>

There is $N$ subjects and $M$ rooms. We know the number of student participating in subjects and the capacities of rooms. There are several pair of subject that can't be arranged in the same period since they have at least one common student.
Our goal is to arrange all subjects such that the schedule satisfies all constraints and have the lowest number of periods. The detail of problem is presented in our report.
